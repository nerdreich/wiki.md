# wiki.md Themes

wiki.md includes the **Elegant** theme, which is enabled by default.

## Install a 3rd party theme

To switch to another theme, follow the installation instructions that is bundled with it. This usually boils down to:

* Extract the `*.tar.gz`/`*.zip` of the theme.
* Copy the theme folder into `themes/` of your wiki.md installation.
* Edit `data/config.ini` and change the `theme` entry to its folder name (which is case-sensitive).

## Create your own theme

See [Creating themes](themes_create.md) how to make your own theme.
